# Markus Pasanen — Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is meant to showcase my work as a full-stack developer and COMOS specialist, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and instant deployment using standard GitHub functionality.

## ✨ Features

- **Simple & Clean:**  
  Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build steps, just fast and readable code.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
- **SEO & Social Ready:**  
  Includes meta tags for SEO, Open Graph, and Twitter cards.
- **Instant Deployment:**  
  Deployed automatically via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) — just push to `main` and your site is live.
- **Easy Maintenance:**  
  All content is in a single repository. Update your portfolio by editing [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css), and [script.js](script.js).

## 🚀 Instant Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages:

1. **Custom Domain:**  
   Set via the [CNAME](CNAME) file (`pasanen.dev`).
2. **Automatic Publishing:**  
   Every push to the `main` branch is instantly published at [https://pasanen.dev](https://pasanen.dev).
3. **No Build Tools Required:**  
   Just static files — works out of the box with GitHub Pages.
